    <h1>SportsHi From Ideation to&nbsp;Launch<br>–</h1>
    <p>We set out the create the home of high school sports. After a simple MVP and many iterations, our team has created a dynamic product serving the interests of athletes, coaches, and fans. While we started as a team management app, SportsHi's primary focus became communication among players and teams, simple connection to college coaches, and high school sports content.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The founder of SportsHi approached me at the end of 2016 to help create a quick brand identity (a placeholder until we rebranded to SportsHi) to pitch a concept he had for a high school sports app.</p>
    <div id="two">
    <div class="columns">
    <div class="content"><h3 style="font-family: Akkurat-Bold">Problem</h3><p>Gen Z live their life online but not with high school sports. When they do choose engage with sports online they are using many platforms.</p></div>
    <div class="content"><h3 style="font-family: Akkurat-Bold">Solution</h3><p>Create a single platform for high schoolers to connect with their team and other athletes, post sports content, and easily connect with college coaches.</p></div>
    </div>
    </div>

    <h2>From concept to pitch</h2>
    <p>Before prototyping, I created a pitch deck to communicate the concept to advisors and potential investors. Over the years, there have been hundreds of iterations of the deck. They have successfully helped secure funding from angels and funds, including <a class="bluelink" href="http://www.37angels.com">37 Angels</a> which I played an integral role in pitching and diligence.</p>
    <br>
    <div class="work-full"><img src="img/app/decks.jpg" /></div>
    <br><p style="text-align: center; font-size: 12px;">We were originally Sportswise and used this brand to pitch the initial concept to advisors and investors.<br></p>

    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <h2>Designing the MVP</h2>
    <h3>Research & Usability Tests</h3>
    <p>From the beginning, we met and spoke with student athletes to understand what they're missing and need regarding a digital high school sports experience. We continue to meet with boys from Fordham Prep and girls from Columbia Secondary School to focus group and usability test prototypes and new releases.</p>
    <div class="work-full"><img src="img/app/usertest.jpg" /></div><br>
    <p style="font-family: Akkurat-Bold;">Key Takeaways</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Competitor apps were built for coaches and parents in design and functionality.</li>
    <li>Vanity metrics such as numerical likes are stressful and not wanted on new platforms.</li>
    <li>Recognition is the biggest driver of engagement.</li>
    <li>Inter-school rivarly between teams is more powerful than rivarly between schools.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>User Journey</h3>
    <p>Determining how to create an <span class="bluelink">emotional connection with the user in the first 60 seconds</span> was the most crucial aspect of crafting a user's journey. Once registered, the goal is to appeal to the primal emotions of sports we determined from focus groups with the athletes (belogingness, team spirit, and competitiveness) and then introduce gamification to hook the user. Gamification levels first act as an onboarding tool but then offer a path for users to get their content on the Explore page– recognition.</p>

    <p>SportsHi launched at the end of 2018<br>in the <a class="bluelink" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sportshi/id1319468206">App Store</a> and <a class="bluelink" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sportshi&hl=en_US">Google Play Store.</a></p></div>

    <h3>An app for students, coaches, and fans</h3>
    <p>Each type of user has a dedicated experience, catering to what they find most important but <span class="bluelink">students were always priotized in design</span>. The student UX is content heavy with the most functionality/permissions, the coach UX prioritizes team management, and the fan (often parents) UX is view-only to follow along with teams but not invade the high school space.</p>
    <br>
    <div class="work-full"><img src="img/app/roles.png" /></div>

    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <h3>Content</h3>
    <span class="bold">Explore</span>
    <p>The home of content on SportsHi lives on the Explore page. Verified content creators get priority for videos they upload in larger real estate spaces. Smaller thumbnails represent a reverse chronological feed of images uploaded to the platform for all users. Users can favorite any profile (school, team, and user) which appears at the top of the screen– similar to following but without the stress of building a following based on numbers.</p>
    <br>
    <div class="work-full"><img src="img/app/explore.png" /></div>
    <br><br>
    <span class="bold">Galleries</span>
    <p>All profiles have galleries. Content is uploaded to user galleries and then tagged to appear on school, team, and user profiles (under the tagged tab on user profiles).</p>
