    <p>I’m a senior designer based between New York City and Berlin. I focus on web design, mobile apps, and UI/UX.</p>

    <p>Lately, I have been designing and building beautiful websites for startups.</p>

    <p>Before that, I co-founded and was Head of Design at <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sportshi">SportsHi (now Breakthru)</a>, a venture-backed platform for students to easily apply and receive scholarships funded by professional athletes and organizations.</p>

    <p>I have also exhibited work and held exhibitions in New York City and Mexico City and performed as a DJ around the world. Right now, I run and handle design for a collective called <a href="https://bleak.wtf/">Bleak</a> which focuses on platforming Queer electronic music artists.</p>

    <p>I have worked with with multinational corporations, NGOs, nonprofits, museums, boutique firms, local businesses, and startups. Some companies I have worked with include Rent the Runway, Saks, Harry’s, Goldman Sachs, National Geographic, and Smithsonian.</p>

    <p>Throughout my career, I proved my ability to create effective design solutions based on a deep understanding of user-based product design with regard to scale, business objectives, and engineering resources.</p>
