        <p>Product Evolution - Defining the Problem</p>

        <span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgba(250, 250, 250, 0.6)">2017</span><br><br>
        We founded Sportswise as a social network for high school sports. Our co-founder, a high school sports coach, saw a disconnect between team management between coaches and athletes. Teams were using a variety of platforms (from email, social networks, to game tracking apps) to manage their athletics. We sought out to fix this by creating a single app that combined team management, sports social media, and team communication.

        <b>College Connection</b><br>
        We worked closely with a two New York City high school rugby teams (one all boys and the other all girls). The most important thing on their mind was getting into college. So we pivoted and made college connection a priority. We introduced a Colleges tab on the app where students could review college sports programs and connect to coaches with one tap.

        <p class="project-content-description">
        SportsHi would only send the pertinent information (high school, sport, GPA, and contact) to college coaches who were often inundated with lengthy overly descriptive emails from college hopefuls. NCAA rules did not permit coaches to reach out to students, this was a simple way of opening this blocked line of communication.

        <b>Two-way Platform</b><br>
        Students could now connect with coaches via the app and we built a web portal for administrators and coaches to review the students who reached out to their program.

        <b>Reducing Barriers - Easy Scholarship Application</b><br>
        Despite making communication to college programs easy, the biggest barrier to college access for students was financial. We changed focus completely away from team management and focuses on college connection and introduced easy application to scholarships. We added a tab where students could apply to scholarships funded athletes, celebrities, and organizations. The applications could be completed in under 5 minutes.

        <b>Ambassador Program - Building Micro-Communities</b><br>
        We continue to build out the scholarship platform and introduce a SportsHi Ambassador Program. Students in the program complete tasks relating to SportsHi as a company, engage in resume building internship experience, and act as the main user testing group. Over 5,000 students joined and graduated from the program.<br><br>
        Key to the Ambassador Program was building out micro-communities within schools. To join the program, a SportsHi Club Chapter needed to be created at a high school. Each chapt had a President which was reflected in the app. Having SportsHi clubs functioning within schools greatly increased our app outreach and built brand loyalty generically.

        SportsHi rebrands to Breakthru and now focuses on creating a new way for youth to earn by engaging with companies. The learn-to-earn model which gives students real world learning experience within the app. Students earn cash while completing tasks within the app.

        <p>Research + Testing</p>
        <p class="project-content-description">
          Key to defining the problem and the evolution of the product was user testing and an active and open line of communication with our users. From inception, we engaged test teams and schools to use the product (including beta launches of new features) and provide feedback via messaging and user testing sessions. This evolved into the SportsHi Ambassador Program where thousands students from the across the country actively provided feedback on the product directly within the SportsHi app.

        <p>Design System</p>
        <p class="project-content-description">
          SportsHi was an experience of proving concept, pivoting, and iterating. As we swapped features in and out quickly, it became clear we needed a system to guide our design to keep consistency and allow rapid design and buildout of new features. At the end of 2019, I built our design system which now guides design at the company today.<br><br>The system contains guides for: titles and text, colors, interaction states, avatars and images, standard UI properties, grids and typesetting, actions, form elements, lists, overlays, navigation, iconography, and more.
